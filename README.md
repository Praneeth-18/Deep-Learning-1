In this project, I've built three distinct models using Teachable Machines: an image model, a pose model, and an audio model. Each model demonstrates unique applications of machine learning in recognizing images, poses, and sounds, respectively. These models were designed to be intuitive and accessible, making them perfect for educational purposes or anyone interested in the basics of machine learning.

## Project Description


- **Image Model**: Recognizes and classifies different images based on the training data it was provided.
- **Pose Model**: Identifies various human poses, demonstrating the application of machine learning in motion and gesture recognition.
- **Audio Model**: Distinguish between different sounds, showcasing how machine learning can be applied in audio analysis.


## Demo
